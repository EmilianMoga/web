	<p>This started in 1996 with Air in the Paragraph Line, a zine produced by Jon Konrath as a newsletter to document <br> his writing exploits and mail to his friends. After six issues and an extended hiatus, the format expanded in 2005 to a small <br>literary journal of writing by Konrath and several other writers. He published work he enjoyed reading, the kind of fiction and <br> fact that kept him glued to the pages, in hopes that others would like it, too.</p>
